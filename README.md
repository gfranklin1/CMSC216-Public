## Projects and Exercises

### Project 1: **Grades Calculator**
**Description:**  
- Developed a command-line program in C for calculating and managing assignment grades based on user inputs.
- Reads user input assignment details, including scores, weights, and days late, and calculates a numeric score after applying penalties for late submissions.
- Handles dropping the lowest scores based on user specifications.
- Can optionally provide statistical information about the grades, such as the mean and standard deviation. 

**Grade:** [Grade Received]

### Project 2: **Document Manager**
**Description:**  
- Developed a C library for managing a document structure, allowing users to create, modify, and print documents composed of multiple paragraphs and lines.
- Implemented essential functionalities, including initializing documents, adding/removing paragraphs and lines, loading content from an array, and replacing/highlighting/removing text within the document.

### Exercise 1: **Draw Figures**
**Description:**  
- Developed a command-line program in C that allows users to draw geometric shapes based on their input.
- Users can choose to draw a rectangle or a triangle:
  - **Rectangle:** Drawn using two characters, where alternate rows use different characters. Users provide width and length for the rectangle.
  - **Triangle:** Drawn using two characters with random placement determined by a seed value. Users provide the size of the triangle and a random seed for the pattern.
- Includes input validation to ensure valid values for characters and dimensions.

**Grade:** 100/100

### Exercise 2: **Text Manipulation**
**Description:**  
- Implemented two functions in C: `remove_spaces` and `center`, aimed at practicing string and pointer manipulation.
  - **remove_spaces**: This function removes leading and trailing spaces from a given string and places the cleaned string in the result parameter.
  - **center**: This function centers a given string within a specified width by calculating the required number of spaces on both sides.
- This implementation shows rigorous specifications regarding input validation, string handling, and proper null-termination, ensuring the code adheres to good programming style. 
**Grade:** 100/100
